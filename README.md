# OmniAuth Harvest

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/corewebdesign/omniauth-harvest.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/corewebdesign/omniauth-harvest)

Harvest OAuth2 Strategy for OmniAuth 1.0. Largely inspired by Shopify's OmniAuth strategy: https://github.com/Shopify/omniauth-shopify-oauth2

## Installing

Add to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-harvest-oauth2', require: 'omniauth-harvest'
```

Then run `bundle install`.

## Usage

Read the OmniAuth 1.0 docs for detailed instructions on using OmniAuth: https://github.com/intridea/omniauth.

You will need to set up your application in your Harvest account `https://<companyname>.harvestapp.com/oauth2_clients`. Support for receiving these details from users (for accessing multiple accounts) will be coming soon.

To use this in Rails, for example, add the following in `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :harvest, ENV['HARVEST_IDENTIFIER'], ENV['HARVEST_SECRET']
end
```

There is also a simple Sinatra example in ./example/config.ru

## Authentication Hash

Here's an example *Authentication Hash* available in `request.env['omniauth.auth']`:

```ruby
{
  :provider => 'harvest',
  :credentials => {
    :token => 'afasd923kjh0934kf', # OAuth 2.0 access_token; use this for authenticating API requests
  }
}
```
